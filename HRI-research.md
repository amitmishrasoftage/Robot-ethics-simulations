Human-Robot Interaction(HRI) os a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the study, design, and evaluation of roborts as they interact with humans in various contexts. HRI research encompasses a wide range of topics, including social robotics, user experience, ethics, and the psychological aspects of human-robot relationships. 
Here are some key areas of HRI research.

## Social Robotics:
    Studying the design and development of robots that can engage in social interactions with humans.

## User Experience(UX) in HRI:
     Exploring the user experience of interacting with robots in different settings.
